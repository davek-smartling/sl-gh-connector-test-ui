# sl-gh-connector-test-ui for github connector testing

This is a simple test project to demonstrate the functionality of the translation connector. It includes an `index.html` page with placeholders for text that can be translated into different languages.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: A simple webpage with text content that can be translated.
- `locales/`: A folder containing JSON files for translations (e.g., English, French).

## How It Works

- The `index.html` file uses placeholders (e.g., `{{header}}`) for dynamic text.
- The JSON files in the `locales/` folder contain key-value pairs for translating these placeholders.
- The translation connector will retrieve the text content and replace the placeholders with the appropriate translations based on the locale.
